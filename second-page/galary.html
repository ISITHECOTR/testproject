    <p class="text">Timing entities</p>

    <p class="text_main">Along with races and timing events under the rules of their respective sanctioning bodies, 
        the operators of the track have instituted official rules as of 2019 that govern the measurement and certification of lap time on the Nordschleife, 
        with measurement over the full length of the track timed with a flying start. 
        Timekeeping is supervised by a notary and the vehicles are scrutineered with regard to their series-production state.</p>

    <p class="text">Timing by media</p>

    <p class="text_main">The German magazine sport auto publishes its "Supertest" of cars, in which the lap time (usually driven by editor-in-chief Horst von Saurma) at the Nordschleife is the most discussed result. 
        The magazine also runs a challenge for the fastest lap time driven with a car that is road legal (TÃœV) and registered in Germany. The road legality rule also applies for the tyres.
        British motorcycle magazine Performance Bikes began testing their bikes in a regular feature at the Nordschleife in March 2007 and finished in December 2007. 
        Bikes were tested by Dale Lomas and Brendan Keirle (then known only as "The Baron").[5] As with sport auto, all machines tested are road-legal (MOT) and shod with road-legal Bridgestone BT002 Pro Race tyres. 
        To date there are 28 lap times published in the regular feature. 
        As motorcycles are forbidden to participate in industry pool sessions and after-hours test sessions, Performance Bikes were forced to test during quiet mid-week tourist sessions, where speed limits apply in some sections. 
        This means their lap times are measured from bridge to gantry (see below) and are approximately 22 seconds shorter than a full 20.832 km (12.944 mi) Nordschleife lap.
        Nordschleife runs are conducted or observed by various other media outlets, such as the British Evo Magazine or Auto Bild from Germany.</p>
